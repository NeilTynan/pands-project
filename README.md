# Programming and Scripting

This README has been written with [GitHub's documentation on README's](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind.

## About this Project

This repository contains my weekly assignments for ATU module 4122 -- PROGRAMMING AND SCRIPTING. It contains the project work for the course, which is focused on the Iris dataset. As part of this, this project intends to:

1. Provide an outline of the Iris dataset and the data it contains;
2. Download a copy of the data set into the repository;
3. Write a program called analysis.py that: 
    - Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file;
    - Saves a histogram of each variable to png files;
    - Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables;
    - Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate.

## Use of this Project

This repository may be of some interest to other students engaged in similar projects around programming and scripting. Feel free to use whatever you like from it (though if another party has been referenced, I would ask that you likewise cite them).

## Getting Started

The workbook is structured in a linear fashion, so reading through it from start to finish is the best approach.

To understand how the workbook has developped to date, please see below a timeline of the work done on the notebook and the material referenced in the course of this work:

- 21/03/2025 - Created ReadMe and Gitignore file. Gitignore file generated using the template at Python gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore, the Windows gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/Windows.gitignore, the MacOS gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/macOS.gitignore and the Linux gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/Linux.gitignore.
- 22/03/2025 - Created analysis.py and Iris.ipynb. Loaded in the Iris dataset, using the instructions at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris.
- 23/03/2025 - Saved a copy of the Iris dataset into the directory. External materials referenced: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html (how to save a dataset as a csv dataframe).
